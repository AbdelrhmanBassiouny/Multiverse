# Multiverse

Multiverse is a simulation framework designed to integrate multiple advanced physics engines such as [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/), [Project Chrono](https://projectchrono.org/), and [SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) along with various photo-realistic graphics engines like [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) and [Omniverse](https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse). Additionally, Multiverse provides the capability to generate knowledge graphs dynamically during runtime.
